SocialEvaluationModels includes code for modelling variants of Kate Button's Social Evaluation Task,
especially the computational psychiatry project of Michelle Solomon.

The structure of the code is as follows: A part of the agent (person!) learns directly from the trials experienced. 
This is the 'learning hub', which may have 'reporting spokes'. The latter may include processes that process
the core beliefs and provide answers. For example, the 'hub' may consider that a person may be basically positive 
or negative towards us (two categories), but be uncertain about which obtains. It may thus have a belief
'this person has a 30% chance of being positive, and 70% of being negative'. The 'reporting spoke' may then
combine this, so if asked 'How likely is it that this person will treat you positively', they 
answer by p(pos treatment | positive person) p(pos person) + p(pos treat | neg person) p(neg person) ,
a process 'read out' off the learning hub by the 'reporting spoke'
